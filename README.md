# CroALa index locorum: a gazetteer of place names in Croatian Latin texts

A project supported by a [Pelagios Commons resource development grant](http://commons.pelagios.org/2016/07/announcing-the-pelagios-commons-resource-development-grant-recipients/).

Using the CITE Architecture, a number of analytical exemplars of the CroALa texts, and elements from different formal ontologies, a set of place name references in the text will be semantically annotated. The annotations will be reviewed and published according to the [Pelagios guidelines for interconnection](https://github.com/pelagios/pelagios-cookbook/wiki).
