# CroALa index locorum: a gazetteer of place names in Croatian Latin texts

A project supported by a Pelagios 

Using the CITE Architecture, a number of analytical exemplars of the CroALa texts, and elements from different formal ontologies, a set of place name references in the text will be semantically annotated. The annotations will be reviewed and published according to the [Pelagios guidelines for interconnection](https://github.com/pelagios/pelagios-cookbook/wiki).
