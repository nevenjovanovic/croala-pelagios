# Interim report on the CroALa Index Locorum for the Pelagios Blog

We have been building the [CroALa Index Locorum](https://github.com/nevenjovanovic/croala-pelagios/wiki) for three months now, and the end is in sight. Looking at what we have learned (and what we're still learning), the stuff seems to fall into one of three categories. There were *technical* problems to be solved, *linked data* infrastructure and sources that we were lucky to be able to build on and reuse, and *conceptual issues* -- main sources of our headaches and just-don't-get-into-metaphysics agonies during meetings. Below are highlights from each category, for you to choose according to preferences and inclinations.
