# Interim report on the CroALa Index Locorum for the Pelagios Blog

Soon it will be three months that we're building the [CroALa Index Locorum](https://github.com/nevenjovanovic/croala-pelagios/wiki). Looking at what we have learned (and what we're still learning), the stuff seems to fall into one of three categories. There were *technical* problems to be solved, *linked data* sources that we are building on, and *conceptual issues* -- main sources of our headaches and just-don't-get-into-metaphysics agonies during meetings. Here are highlights from each category, for you to choose according to preferences and inclinations.

## Technical

## Linked data

## Conceptual
